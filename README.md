# Hospital Appointment Booking

This is a React + TypeScript single-page application for managing outpatient appointments.
Patients can create appointments by selecting doctors, choosing available dates and times,
and the system generates token numbers for scheduled visits. Administrators can review
clinic activity through the dashboard view.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd pro
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs with Vite. By default it is available at
http://localhost:5173, and it reloads automatically as you edit files in `src/`.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/BookAppointment.tsx` – primary workflow for creating patient appointments
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` – overview of daily appointments and statistics
- `src/lib/storage.ts` – client helpers for working with the backend API
- `api/*.php` – PHP endpoints for persisting patients, doctors, and appointments

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui component library
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- PHP backend scripts for database access

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build the production bundle
- `npm run build:dev` – build using the development mode configuration
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on the project

## Deployment

Any static hosting platform that supports single-page applications can serve the
production build generated by `npm run build`. Deploy the compiled assets in `dist/`
and configure the server to fallback to `index.html` for unmatched routes. The PHP
API endpoints in `api/` should be hosted on a server with PHP 8+ and a connection
to the corresponding database described in `public/hospital_schema.sql`.
